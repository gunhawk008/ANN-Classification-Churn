Sequential Nw
Dense - create neuron/node
activation function - sigmoid,softmax
optimizer - updating the weight
loss function
metrics -  accuracy mse mac

Create Venv with requirments.txt 
activate venv


Load all the libraries in exp file
	-sklearn modelselection
	-pandas
	-standard scalar, label encoder

load the data set
	-eliminate the non important features
	-label encoding on gender
	-One hot encoding on geography
	-Add encoded value in data
	-Save pickle file of encoding

Prepare the train and testing data
	- using skitlear's train test split do xtrain xtest ytrain ytest
	- scaling the feature using standard scaler's fit_tranform on X data
	- save pickle file of scaling

Prepare the Model
	- Import lib
	- sequential model with dense as layers 
	- add optimizer's learning rate and loss using binary cross entropy
	- Compile the model using optimizer,loss,mertrics as accuracy

Setup tensorboard (To Get a good view)
	- setup log file
	- callback with histogram and log file
	- Setup early stopping with monitoring val_loss with patience as 10 epochs and restoring the best weights

Training the model
	-model.fit with all datasets(xtrain xtest ytrain ytest),epochs and callbacks
	-Save the model
	-Load Tensorboard Extension

Check the model
	- In new file Load the model,encoder and scaler
	- Add input data , perform label encoding on gender and One hot encoding on geography and scaling on entire data to get it in model's format
	- Run Model on new data

Make app using Streamlit
	- load all the model,encoder,scaler
	- take user input of all col using streamlit
	- add that to a var
	- perform  label encoding on gender and One hot encoding on geography and scaling on entire data to get it in model's format
	- Run Model on new data
